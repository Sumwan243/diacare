# Diabetic Assistant - Flutter Starter Repo

This starter includes:
- Hive local storage for quick prototyping
- Provider-based state management
- Quick screens: Home, Add Glucose, Reminders
- Local notifications scaffold for medication reminders

How to run:
1. Create a Flutter project and replace files as above.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. On Android, ensure notification permissions and add required AndroidManifest changes for foreground services if you plan background alarms.

This repo is an MVP scaffold. Next steps: add validation, charts, AI summary endpoint, secure backup, and tests.
